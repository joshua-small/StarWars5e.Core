# Chapter 6: Customization Options

![PqYzVdr](https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PqYzVdr.png)he combination of ability scores, species, class, and background defines your character's capabilities in the game, and the personal details you create set your character apart from every other character. Even within your class and species, you have options to fine-tune what your character can do. But this chapter is for players who—with the GM's permission—want to go a step further.

This chapter expands on feats, which are special options you can choose instead of increasing your ability scores as you gain levels. Your GM decides whether these options are available in a campaign.

#### Class Weapon Proficiencies

Certain classes—berserker, consular, engineer, fighter, guardian, and scout—have proficiency in all of a type of weapon. For instance, fighters are proficient in all blasters and all vibroweapons. Consequently, fighters have proficiency in all blasters and vibroweapons present in Chapter 5. Other classes—monks, operatives, scholars, and sentinels—have proficiency in a certain set of weapons. For each of these classes, they gain proficiency in only certain weapons, as shown below in the Weapon Proficiencies by Class table:

##### Weapon Proficiencies by Class

|Class|Weapon Proficiencies|
|:--|:--|
|Berserker|All vibroweapons, simple blasters|
|Consular|Simple lightweapons, simple vibroweapons|
|Engineer|Simple blasters, simple vibroweapons|
|Fighter|All blasters, all vibroweapons|
|Guardian|All lightweapons, all vibroweapons|
|Monk|Simple blasters, simple vibroweapons, bolas|
|Operative|Simple vibroweapons, simple blasters, bolas, electrobaton, incinerator pistol, riot baton, riot shocker, sonic pistol, vibroknife, wristblade|
|Scholar|Simple blasters, simple vibroweapons, electrobaton, incinerator pistol, sonic pistol, vibroknife|
|Scout|All blasters, all vibroweapons|
|Sentinel|Simple vibroweapons, simple lightweapons, bolas, chained dagger, chained lightdagger, electrobaton, electrostaff, guard shoto, lightfist, riot baton, riot shocker, vibroshield, vibroknife, vibrotonfa, war hat, wristblade|

## Feats

A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Inspiring Leader feat requires you to have a Charisma of 13 or higher. If your Charisma is reduced below 13 somehow—perhaps by a withering curse—you can't benefit from the Inspiring Leader feat until your Charisma is restored.

### Class Improvement

_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_
You adopt a particular new application to your class, gaining the following benefits:

- Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.

- Choose one of the class improvement options, detailed later in this chapter.

You can take this feat multiple times.

### Multiclass Improvement

_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_
You've learned to blend the skills of your different classes. Choose two of the multiclass improvement options, detailed later in this chapter. You can take this feat multiple times.

### Splashclass Improvement

_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_
You've learned to blend the skills of your different classes. Choose one of the splashclass improvement options, detailed later in this chapter. You can take this feat multiple times.

## Class Improvements

The Class Improvement feat offers your choice of class improvement. You must meet a class improvement's requirement in order to choose that class improvement. You can't choose a class improvement more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

> #### Alternate Class Feature
>
> Consider offering class improvements as an alternate class feature, replacing an existing feature as shown in the list below:
>
> - For berserkers, replace Danger Sense.
>
> - For consulars, replace Force Affinity.
>
> - For engineers, replace Infuse Item.
>
> - For fighters, replace Second Wind.
>
> - For guardians, replace a Channel the Force option.
>
> - For monks, replace Deflect Missile.
>
> - For operatives, replace Bad Feeling.
>
> - For scholars, replace Sage Advice.
>
> - For scouts, replace Pathfinder.
>
> - For sentinel, replace Led by the Force.
>
> If you choose to use these as alternate class features, consider waiving the required levels in the chosen class. If the character wants to regain the replaced feature, allow them to take the Class Improvement feat at 4th level, regaining the replaced feature instead of a class improvement.

You may choose your class improvement from the following options or roll on the table below to determine it randomly.

If you determine your class improvement randomly, and the result is an improvement for which you are ineligible, simply reroll until you get a proper result.

#### Berserker

_**Prerequisite:** At least 3 levels in berserker_
When a creature ends its turn within 15 feet of you, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed to a space closer to the creature. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

When a creature has a Potent Aptitude die from you and casts a power, they can roll the die and add the number rolled to one damage or healing roll of the power. If the power would damage or heal multiple targets, this bonus only applies to one of them. The Potent Aptitude die is then lost.

#### Fighter

As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force to regain 2 force points. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the guardian table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

#### Monk

## Multiclass Improvements

The Multiclass Improvement feat offers your choice of two multiclass improvements. You must meet a multiclass improvement's requirement in order to choose that multiclass improvement. You can't choose a multiclass improvement more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

You may choose your multiclass improvements from the following options or roll on the table below to determine it randomly.

|d10|Class|

|1|Berserker|
|2|Consular|
|3|Engineer|
|4|Fighter|
|5|Guardian|
|6|Monk|

> #### Multiclass Improvements Example
>
> Drew is playing a character with 4 levels in fighter and 3 levels in operative. When he reaches 8th level, he takes a 4th-level in operative. Rather than taking the Ability Score Improvement class features, Drew opts to take the Multiclass Improvement feat. Since he only has the two eligible classes, he takes the Fighter and Operative options, allowing him to add half his 4 operative levels to his 4 fighter levels, as if he was a 6th-level fighter. This increases the hit points he regains from Second Wind to 1d10 + 6, as well as the size of his superiority die also increases to a d6. This doesn't affect his number of superiority dice, however, since a fighter doesn't gain an additional die until 7th level. He also adds half his 4 fighter levels to his 4 operative levels, increasing his Sneak Attack dice to 3d6, from 2d6.

#### Berserker

_**Prerequisite:** At least 3 levels in berserker_
You can add half your other chosen class's levels (rounded down) to your berserker levels when determining the number of times you can enter a rage and the bonus to weapon damage rolls while raging.

#### Engineer

_**Prerequisite:** At least 3 levels in engineer_
You can add your other chosen class's levels to your engineer levels when determining the size of your Potent Aptitude die and the number of uses of your Potent Aptitude feature, and you gain 1 tech point for every two of your other chosen class's levels.

#### Fighter

_**Prerequisite:** At least 3 levels in fighter_
You can add half your other chosen class's levels (rounded down) to your fighter levels when determining the number of hit points you regain from your Second Wind feature, the size of your superiority dice, and the number of superiority dice you have.

#### Guardian

_**Prerequisite:** At least 3 levels in guardian_
You can add half your other chosen class's levels (rounded down) to your guardian levels when determining your amount of Focused Strikes dice and your number of uses of Channel the Force.

#### Scholar

_**Prerequisite:** At least 3 levels in scholar_

## Splashclass Improvements

The Splashclass Improvement feat offers your choice of splashclass improvement. You must meet a splashclass improvement's requirement in order to choose that splashclass improvement. You can't choose a splashclass improvement more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

You may choose your splashclass improvement from the following options or roll on the table below to determine it randomly.

|d10|Class|
|:--:|:--|
|1|Berserker|
|2|Consular|
|3|Engineer|
|4|Fighter|
|5|Guardian|
|6|Monk|
|7|Operative|
|8|Scholar|
|9|Scout|
|10|Sentinel|

If you determine your splashclass improvement randomly, and the result is an improvement for which you are ineligible, simply reroll until you get a proper result.

#### Berserker

_**Prerequisite:** No levels in berserker_
On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action if you aren't wearing heavy armor.

While raging, you gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.

- You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage.

If you are able to cast powers, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious, you don heavy armor, or if your turn ends and you haven't taken a hostile action or taken damage since your last turn. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

You can use this feature once. You gain an additional use at 11th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

#### Consular

_**Prerequisite:** No levels in consular, the ability to cast force powers_
You gain the ability to twist your powers to suit your needs. When you cast a force power, you can expend additional force points to modify the power. You gain one of the Force-Empowered Casting options of your choice from those available to the consular class. You gain an additional option at 11th level.

You can only spend a number of force points in this way equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain the ability to do so when you complete a long rest.

#### Engineer

_**Prerequisite:** No levels in engineer_
Your technological experience lends you an uncommon insight that you can use to bolster your allies. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Potent Aptitude die, a d4.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Potent Aptitude die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Potent Aptitude die is rolled, it is lost.

A creature can have only one Potent Aptitude die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Fighter

_**Prerequisite:** No levels in fighter_
You learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

_**Maneuvers.**_ You learn one maneuver of your choice from those available to the fighter class. You learn an additional maneuver at 11th level. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack, and you may only use each maneuver once per turn.

_**Superiority Dice.**_ You have a number of superiority dice equal to your proficiency bonus, which are d4s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a long rest.

_**Saving Throws.**_ Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

___

**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)

___

#### Guardian

_**Prerequisite:** No levels in guardian, the ability to cast force powers_
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend force points to deal additional damage to the target, which is the same type as the weapon's damage. The additional damage is 1d8 for each point spent in this way. You can't deal more than 2d8 additional damage per hit in this way.

You can only spend a number of force points in this way equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain the ability to do so when you complete a long rest.

#### Monk

_**Prerequisite:** No levels in monk_
Your practice of martial arts grants you the following benefits:

- You can make an unarmed strike as a bonus action. If you would already make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, you can instead make this strike in addition to that unarmed strike.

- You can take the Disengage action as a bonus action. If you would already Disengage as a bonus action, you can instead also Dodge.

- You can take the Dash action as a bonus action. If you would already Dash as a bonus action, you can instead double your jump distance for the turn.

You can use these features a combined number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

#### Operative

_**Prerequisite:** No levels in operative_
You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with a weapon attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. This damage is the same as the weapon's damage, and the attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.

You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

You can deal this additional damage a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

#### Scholar

_**Prerequisite:** No levels in scholar_
You are able to analyze a target, develop a plan on how to best overcome any potential obstacle, and execute that plan with ruthless efficiency. As a bonus action on your turn, you can analyze a target you can see within 60 feet of you. For the next minute, or until you analyze another target, you gain the following benefits:

- When you analyze a hostile creature, your attack and damage rolls made with weapons with the finesse property or blaster weapons against that target may use your Intelligence modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity.

- When you analyze a friendly creature, the target can end your Critical Analysis on them (no action required) to add your Intelligence modifier to one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once a friendly creature has benefited from this ability, they can not do so again until they complete a short or long rest.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, rounded up. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

#### Scout

_**Prerequisite:** No levels in scout_
You learn how to effectively read and track your prey. Once on each of your turns, you can choose a creature you can see within 120 feet and mark it as your quarry (no action required). For the next hour, you gain the following benefits:

- Once per turn, when you hit the target with a weapon attack, you can deal 1d4 additional damage to it of the same type as the weapon's damage.

- You have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check you make to find it while it's on the same planet as you.

You can only have one creature marked in this way at a time. You can mark creatures in this way a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, rounded up. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

#### Sentinel

_**Prerequisite:** No levels in sentinel, the ability to cast force powers_
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 force point to use a Force-Empowered Self effect. You have three such effects: Deflection, Double Strike, and Slow Time. You can only use each effect once per turn, and you can only use one effect per hit.

_**Deflection.**_ You can roll a d4 and add it to your AC against one attack before the start of your next turn.

_**Double Strike.**_ You can roll a d4 and deal additional damage of the same type equal to the amount rolled.

_**Slow Time.**_ You can roll a d4 to increase your speed by 5 x the amount rolled until the end of your turn.

You can only spend a number of force points in this way equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain the ability to do so when you complete a long rest.
