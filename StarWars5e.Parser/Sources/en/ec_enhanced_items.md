#### Charge, Fragmentation (Average)
_**Consumable** (explosive), <font style="color:green">**premium**</font>_<br>
A device used to blow holes in larger constructs and structures, a charge creates a devastating explosion focused in a specific direction. Installing a charge takes 1 minute. The charge can be set with a 6-second timer, or detonated remotely using a remote detonator.

When detonated, the charge explodes in a 15-foot cone. Each creature within the cone must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 20d6 kinetic damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. If affixed to a creature, that creature has disadvantage on the saving throw. Objects, structures, and other surfaces have disadvantage on the saving throw. If affixed to the object, structure, or surface, it instead automatically fails this saving throw.

#### Restraining Bolt (Fine)
_**Adventuring gear**, <font style="color:green">**premium**</font>_<br>
Restraining bolts are small, cylindrical devices that can be affixed to a droid in order to limit its functions and enforce its obedience. When inserted, a restraining bolt restricts the droid from any movement its master does not desire, and also forced it to respond to signals produced by a hand-held control unit.

Installing a restraining bolt takes 1 minute. The droid must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. A hostile droid makes this save with advantage. On a successful save, the restraining bolt overloads and is rendered useless. On a failed save, the restraining bolt is correctly installed, and the control unit can be used to actively control the droid. While the control unit is inactive, the droid can act freely but it can not attempt to remove the restraining bolt.

_**Consumable** (ammunition), <font style="color:green">**premium**</font>_<br>
When triggered, this enhanced wrist launcher ammunition produces a spray of acid in a line 15 feet long and 5 feet wide or a 15-foot cone. A single fuel canister holds enough fuel for three attacks in a line or a single attack in a cone. Each creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 acid damage, and the first attack it makes before the end of its next turn has disadvantage. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't disadvantaged. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it dies immediately without making death saving throws. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. If you lack proficiency in the wrist launcher, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total.
